## This is the Python version of Techiee! There is a JS version available, however, that one is much less developed. Go to [Techiee.js](https://github.com/MerBudd/Techiee.js) for that.

## What is Techiee?

Techiee is... Well, a chatbot, like ChatGPT or Gemini. It uses the same Gemini (models) that Gemini (the chatbot) is based on, however, in Discord!

Techiee can be VERY random, but I love him for that...

## How to configure Techiee

You can tweak settings like the safety settings, temperature, TopK etc. inside the [config.py](https://github.com/MerBudd/Techiee.py/blob/main/config.py) file.

## How to set Techiee up

All you'll need to do is to set the environment secrets for the Discord Channel ID, your Discord Bot Token (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and your Google AI Studio API Key (which you can grab from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

You can use a hosting service like Render (which is free and works just fine) (render.com), grab your web server URL, and then use the keep_alive.cjs file to run it 24/7 with UptimeRobot (you can find detailed tutorials online). We can't use Replit (at least, if you want to host it 24/7 for free) because they killed their webservers. You can pay Replit to get it running 24/7 with their new "Deployments" if you want.
