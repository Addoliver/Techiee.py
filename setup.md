## How to set Techiee up

All you'll need to do is to set the environment secrets for the Discord Channel ID, your Discord Bot Token (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and your Google AI Studio API Key (which you can grab from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

You can use a hosting service like Render (which is free and works just fine) (render.com), grab your web server URL, and then use the keep_alive.py file to run it 24/7 with UptimeRobot (you can find detailed tutorials online). We can't use Replit (at least, if you want to host it 24/7 for free) because they killed their webservers. You can pay Replit to get it running 24/7 with their new "Deployments" if you want.

You can also host it on your computer.
